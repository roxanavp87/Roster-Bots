# Roster-Bots
Congratulations, you are now the owner of a robot sports team. Each owner is responsible for creating a roster
of player bots for league play. The league requires that your roster be filled out with 10 starters and 5
substitutes. You must submit your roster before you can begin league play.
- Each player bot needs a name, and has three attribute scores associated with each: Speed, Strength and Agility.
- The total sum of the speed, strength, and agility attributes is calculated as the "total attribute score" for each
player bot.
- The league has mandated that the total attribute score of each of your player bots can not exceed 100 points,
and no two players can have the same score, otherwise your team is disqualified from league play.
- The league has also implemented a salary cap. Each team's roster can not exceed 175 points.

### Please generate an algorithm that can name your player bots and generates each attribute accordingly, as well as meeting the specifications of the league.

## Please note the following:
- Each player bot created must have a unique name.
- Each player bot must have an alphanumeric sequence that looks like the following: "ABC1234" (as an
example).
- No two player bots can have the same name.
- No two player bots can have the same total attribute score (speed + strength + agility = total attribute score).
- You may use any sorting algorithm to define your 10 starter bots and 5 substitue bots.
